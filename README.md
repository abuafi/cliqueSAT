# cliqueSAT 

## Description

  K-clique problem iswell known computational problem. Given a G(V,E) and a number K, the problem is to find all possible subgraphs of size K.
  This project aims to solve K-clique problem, by providing GUI and 2 method of computing the subgraphs of size K. 
  

## Usage
